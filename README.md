Music player for singers
Project name: Music player
project instruction:
This is an exercise in making a music player for a new song by singer M-TP. Use HTML, CSS and Javascript technologies. This exercise helped me understand the production of music players, and I also learned about JavaScript binding and event monitoring.
【The imported music is for practice only and does not represent M-TP songs.】
